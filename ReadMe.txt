If we were to do this project over, we certainly would go for a more component-based system as it enables a better workflow and simplicity.
The architecture would also change a bit, as there is no class to represent a proper scene with entities.
However, it was primarily a C++ refresher and not really about a good game and it has certainly helped a lot.
